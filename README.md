This repository contains my solutions to Katas hosted on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/).
Each Kata is a separate Rust project that you can build and run.

# How to run
For each Kata, you can run the following commands within the Kata's directory.

## Run
```bash
cargo run
```

## Testing
```bash
cargo test
```

## Linting
```bash
cargo clippy
```

## Formatting
```bash
cargo fmt
```
